This repository contains the code and projects pertaining to the Coursera Data Science Capstone Project. In this project, I utilized a Machine Learning method called DBSCAN to analyze where in Ogden, UT would be a good location to open up a new restaurant. The Final Project Report is a Word document detailing the full report. You can also access the report on a LinkedIn Article I wrote by clicing here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predicting-good-opening-locations-restaurants-ogden-ut-ashton-sumner/
